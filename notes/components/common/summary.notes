Two React-Portals exist in this application:

  (1) ModalWrapper
  (2) Notification

The main use-case for Portals is for when you need some UI to display outside the normal flow of the markup
In such a case, using a portal allows you to specify two things:
  (1) The UI/Component you want to show
  (2) The parent you want to contain it

Please see documentation for portals here: https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html
